6. The goal of this game is to move around and collect all coins in the map while avoiding enemies. If you collect all coins surrounding a rectangle, the rectangle will be filled. When you fill all 4 rectangles in each corner, you will temporarily be empowered and can attack enemies. When you collect every coin in the map and fill all rectangles, the stage will be cleared and you will move on to the next stage. This will repeat until you lose all your life and the game is over.

7. Press Shift to insert coin, then press Enter to start the game. Use keyboard Arrow Keys(up, down, left right) to move the character. While playing, press S key to make enemies jump to go beneath them.

8. We used key D to make the character empowered and key A to lose that power. Also we used key X to make the game end. These cheat codes helped us to test game mechanics quickly.
